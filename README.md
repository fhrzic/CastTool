# CastTool
Preview of the cast suppression tool

The "data" folder contains the archive "Data.zip." In the archive, there is a "Data" directory that contains two subdirectories: 

* "generated" subdirectory that contains images with the removed cast by the developed Cycle-GAN model.
* "real" subdirectory that contains original images with cast applied. From these images, the images in the "generated" subdirectory are created.

In the "notebook" folder, you can find "Cast_tool_preview.ipynb" that is ready to be run on the Google collab platform. You can follow the instructions in the notebook to make it run (For this purpose, we have also provided a ".html" version of the notebook."
